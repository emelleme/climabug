# Climabug Chatbot

## Overview
Climabug is an interactive chatbot designed to engage users in conversations about climate and environmental sustainability. With a focus on local strategies and global knowledge, Climabug provides information, resources, and guidance on climate-related topics tailored to the user's location. It is equipped with two modes:

- **Blue Climabug**: Specializes in the "blue economy," covering topics related to oceanic and marine ecosystems.
- **Green Climabug**: Focuses on the "green economy," addressing land-based environmental concerns and sustainability practices.

Climabug operates in a continuous learning loop, utilizing the Distributed Autonomous Organizations and Systems (DAOS) framework to enhance its knowledge base and connect with a network of other Climabugs for reinforced learning and data sharing.

## Features

- Responsive and animated Ecobug element that can be embedded into websites.
- XR mode for real-world interactive experiences.
- Text and voice input for user queries.
- Audio responses with VU meter style pulsation animation.
- Distributed learning mechanism based on DAOS principles.

## DAOS Integration

Climabug utilizes DAOS principles as outlined in the attached DAOS draft paper. Key principles include:

- Emergence: Supporting the natural development of Climabug's knowledge network.
- Harmony: Ensuring inclusive and balanced decision-making processes.
- Tool Creation: Emphasizing the importance of continuous innovation.
- Scalability & Adaptability: Allowing Climabug to grow and evolve with changing environmental data.
- No Harm: Prioritizing ethical considerations and the well-being of ecosystems.

The DAOS framework enables Climabug to interact in a decentralized and collaborative environment, reinforcing its learning process through shared data and collective knowledge.
